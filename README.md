My approach
##First convert text to speech in any desired language.- Not in realtime

##Then we will apply it to the realtime text to audia in any language

##then audio to audio translation not in realtime, 

##then real time audio translation in desired language

##then video to video tranlation in desired language -Not in real time.

##Finally Realtime video to video translation in desired language

# My Approach for Realtime video to video translation in desired language
First we will extract audio from video. Then we will extract text from audio , then we will convert the text into desired language, then the translated text will be merged the audio and then the translated audio will be merged into audio

# Benefits of the Project
To be continued!!!!!!
